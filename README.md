## ðŸ—‚ Setting Up the Database

This project uses **MySQL**. If you're setting it up for the first time:

1. Make sure MySQL is installed and running.
2. Create the database:
3. Import the schema and data:
4. Keep Your application.properties as Is
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/taskdb
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=yourpassword
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update

Others just need to set their local MySQL username/password correctly.
